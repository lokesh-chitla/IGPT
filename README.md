### **IntelliRoute GPT – High-Level Overview & Workflow**  

#### **1. Purpose & Functionality**  
- Acts as a **query routing system** that intelligently categorizes user inputs.  
- Ensures **faster response times** by limiting search space based on category selection.  
- Provides **context-aware responses** for more relevant answers.  
- Allows users to **dynamically select multiple categories** to refine their search.

### **2. Workflow Breakdown**  

#### **Step 1: Category Selection (User Interaction Layer)**  
- Users select a category from predefined checkboxes (Technology, Cricket, Academic, etc.).  
- The system dynamically updates and displays the **selected category label** only after a selection is made.  
- Multiple categories can be selected simultaneously.  

#### **Step 2: Input Processing (Query Recognition Layer)**  
- Users type a query into the input box.  
- The system detects the selected category/categories.  
- If multiple categories are selected, the system routes the query to the **most relevant processing logic**.  

#### **Step 3: Response Handling (Output Processing Layer)**  
- Based on the category:  
  - If it's a known category (e.g., Technology, Cricket), the system formats a structured response.  
  - If "Web Search" is selected, it simulates a search request.  
  - If "Others / No-Idea" is selected, the system **delays response generation** to mimic deeper processing.  
- The processed answer is displayed in the output box.

### **3. Algorithm (High-Level Pseudocode)**  

```plaintext
FUNCTION selectCategory(category):
    Retrieve all checkboxes
    Store checked categories in a list
    IF at least one category is selected:
        Display "Selected Query Category"
    ELSE:
        Hide category title

FUNCTION processUserQuery():
    Retrieve user input
    Determine selected category/categories
    IF category is "Technology":
        Generate technology-specific response
    ELSE IF category is "Cricket":
        Generate cricket-related response
    ELSE IF category is "Web Search":
        Simulate search engine query
    ELSE IF category is "Others / No-Idea":
        Display "Processing query... This may take time"
        WAIT 3 seconds
        Display "Sorry, I have no idea about this topic"
    Display the final response
```

### **4. Enhancements & Future Improvements**  

- **AI-Powered Categorization**  
  - Implement **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to **auto-detect the best category** instead of requiring manual selection.  
  - Train a model to suggest **category-based routing** based on past user queries.  

- **Adaptive Query Optimization**  
  - Introduce a **query history feature** to remember frequently selected categories.  
  - Suggest categories dynamically based on past interactions.  

- **API & External Data Integration**  
  - Fetch real-time results via APIs for Web Search-based queries.  
  - Integrate knowledge bases (e.g., Wikipedia, Google Search API) for advanced query resolution.  

- **Multi-Level Query Processing**  
  - If a **query belongs to multiple categories**, split the response accordingly.  
  - Example: "Latest AI trends in Cricket" → Process under both **Technology & Cricket** categories.

### **5. Summary**  
- **IntelliRoute GPT** structures queries into **categorized flows** for faster, more relevant responses.  
- It **dynamically updates UI elements** to reflect user selections.  
- The system follows an **intelligent query-routing algorithm** for efficient response generation.  
- **Future upgrades** can include **NLP, AI categorization, and API integrations** for a more powerful experience.
